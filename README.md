# Vagrant and Puppet / Typesafe Stack (Play Framework)
This is a quick sample configuration using Vagrant and Puppet.

## Purpose
This repo will help us provision a virtual environment running Ubuntu (Lucid) using Vagrant (and Oracle VirtualBox, behind the scenes). Once we've provisioned and configured our virtual environment, we will use the configuration management tool *Puppet* to configure our box with the following:
* Java
* Scala
* Typesafe Stack / Play! framework
* Git
* And all dependenciesâ€¦
